    <p>The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the five oceans, and it is located around the North Pole, also known as the arctic. The Arctic Ocean is mostly covered by ice floating on the surface, but that ice is slowly melting due to climate change. This ocean is also home to many animals, such as polar bears, seals, and walruses. Note: You cannot find penguins in the arctic, they live in the South Pole!</p>
