    <p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean in the world, and it lies between the Americas and Europe and Africa. It is East of the Americas and West of Europe and Africa. The Atlantic Ocean is also one of the most popular oceans, since many people come to swim in them. It has also been a major route for trade and exploration, since Christopher Columbus sailed over this ocean in 1492 to find the Americas. The Atlantic Ocean was also home to the Atlantic Ocean Trade Network and the Trans-Atlantic Trade Network. The Atlantic Ocean also influences the weather, since warm oceans can lead to hurricanes in the Gulf and East America (for example, Florida).</p>
